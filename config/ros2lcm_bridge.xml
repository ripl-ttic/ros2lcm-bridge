# Introduction

    This is the configuration file for the ros2lcm bridge module.
    The bridge is bidirectional ROS <-> LCM.

    The root node contains two elements:
    - <ros2lcm>
    - <lcm2ros>

    Each children of the root node configures one direction (sub-bridge)
    of the bridge, namely ROS->LCM and LCM->ROS.

    Each sub-bridge contains one element of type <link> for each
    topic/channel bridged.

                    Defines the root of the configuration.

                                            messages that were not bridged yet.

                                                of type `sensor_msgs/Image`. We can access the `frame_id`

# The `enable` field

    All the elements of type <ros2lcm>, <lcm2ros>, <link>, support the field `enabled`.
    The value of this field can be "true" or "false". Elements with the flag `enable="false"`
    are not considered, thus, they do not have effect on the configuration of the bridge.

    Note: When an element of type <ros2lcm>, <lcm2ros> is disabled, all its children
    (i.e., <link> elements) are disabled, even though they have the `enable=` field set to "true".
